# newchunks addon for meteor client

this addon adds newchunks to meteor client. i know meteor rejects already intergrated this module into meteor however that addon has lots of useless modules which slow down your game

#how to build

use ./gradlew build

your very smart if you build your own clients because devs can rat the releases
